## About this Wonde project

This is a technical exercise that was given to me by Wonde, which I built in Laravel. The user story for the task was: <i>As a Teacher I want to be able to see which students are in my class each day of the week so that I can be suitably prepared</i>.

I used the Wonde SDK to complete this task, as well as Laravel 9. I used Bulma for my frontend framework.

The user flow of my application is:
- Select your school.
- Select a user from a select element.
- Choose a day you want to view lessons for.
- When the lessons appear, there is lesson period, room and student information.
- The students are alphabetised by surname first.
